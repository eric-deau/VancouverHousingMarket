integration plan:

piece-by-piece starting in order from what the player interacts with from entering website to game completion

handle testing with at least 2 players, ideally 4
ideally integrate and test before next part/step
open up 2~4 browsers to load up the players

!! BUGS !! - delete if they are fixed
- some rare instances where a community card modal is shown for all players ? (need double checking)
- sending a player to jail should end their turn on the first turn (double check, rare bug somewhere?)
- active_card only changed on ending turn -> if a player rolls doubles, lands on a card and then
	a property, they will get the card popup twice
- sometimes a player just randomly drops...?
